# IanMingCloud – Azure Static Web App Portfolio

A one-page static portfolio website built and deployed using Azure Static Web Apps to demonstrate cloud fundamentals, CI/CD workflows, and modern static web hosting.

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my transition into cloud computing and business technology. The site is intentionally built as a lightweight, one-page static application to emphasize reliability, simplicity, and cost-effective cloud deployment.

Rather than focusing on heavy frameworks, this project highlights core web fundamentals and real-world cloud hosting workflows used in small business and entry-level enterprise environments.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Deploying and managing a static website using Azure Static Web Apps
- Understanding of cloud hosting concepts such as DNS, deployment pipelines, and environments
- Use of Git and GitHub for version control and continuous updates
- Ability to translate personal and business requirements into a functional web solution
- Focus on maintainability, clarity, and real-world usability

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Hosting:** Azure Static Web Apps
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **CI/CD:** GitHub-integrated deployment workflow
- **DNS & Networking:** Domain configuration and basic DNS management

## Deployment & Hosting

This website is deployed using Azure Static Web Apps, which provides a fully managed environment for hosting static content with built-in scalability and security.

The deployment workflow is integrated with GitHub, allowing updates to the site to be automatically built and deployed when changes are pushed to the repository. This approach mirrors real-world CI/CD practices used in cloud-based environments while keeping the infrastructure lightweight and cost-efficient.

Custom domain configuration and DNS fundamentals were applied to make the site publicly accessible and production-ready.


## Why This Project Exists

This project was created as both a learning exercise and a professional portfolio. It reflects my approach to cloud and IT work: prioritize clarity, reliability, and practical solutions over unnecessary complexity.

By building and maintaining this site myself, I gained hands-on experience with cloud deployment, troubleshooting, and iterative improvement — skills that translate directly to entry-level cloud, IT operations, and business technology roles.


## Future Improvements

- Expand the portfolio section with additional cloud and business technology projects
- Add monitoring or basic analytics to observe site usage
- Improve accessibility and performance optimization
- Introduce environment separation for testing and production workflows
